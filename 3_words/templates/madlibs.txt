ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well as its sticky sequel, "Through the Looking violin", have enchanted both the young and old cats for the last 73 years, Alice's chubby adventures begin when she dances down a/an grumpy hole and lands in a strange and topsy-turvy jellyfish. There she discovers she can become a tall jigsaw or a small walnuts simply by nibbling on alternate sides of a magic sun. In her travels through Wonderland, Alice respects such remarkable characters as the White milk, the thundering Hatter, the Cheshire army, and even the Queen of panthers. Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an bitter end when Alice awakens from her sandwich.
